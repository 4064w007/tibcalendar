This file is a list of things that have to be done, this should be integrated
in a project management system.

Code standards improvement
==========================
- doxygen documentation
- static code validation against MISRA
- pass //comments into /* standard C syntax */
- compile option for very light version (calendar only)
- adding asserts
- handle errors (naming conventions in the Gnu Code Standards = GCS)
- add changelog file (as in the GCS)
- think about a version convention
- study noweb or CWEB possibility
- complete the bibliography

General development
===================
- Swig/guile bindings
- make a good API for a very basic calendar application (like lunar-applet?)
- mini-gmp vs. gmp compile option
- build a test system based on CuTest
- make a good, portable (native Windows + Unix shell!) keyboard-driven console 
  interface
- make a command-line interface (with just options)
- add some gnulibs file for portability
- get back to autoconf

Specific developments
=====================
- modify the gzadag system for bhutanese calendar
- make a general option system
- rebuild the feast system
- finish Sherab Ling calculations integration
- add the possibility to have several epochs to choose from for one system
- add the possibility to shift timezone (by modifying the epoch)
- add all the calculations for Kalacakra Calendar
