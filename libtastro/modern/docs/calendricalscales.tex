A typical Tibetan almanach contains angle data written in the following form: $x;y;z$ where $x$ is the lunar mansion (27\textsuperscript{th} of circle), $y$ is in nâdis (60\textsuperscript{th} of lunar mansion) and $z$ in pâlas (60th of nâdis). It is almost the same as Western angle notation, but dividing the circle first in 27, not in 360. So a first approach would say that computations must be accurate enough to get these numbers right. In order to get these right, the precision must be at least $0.5 pâla = 6.67 s$\footnote{$1 pâla$ being a $27*60*60^{th}$ of circle and $1s$ being a $360*60*60^{th}$ of circle, we have $1 pâla = 360/27 s = 13.33 s$}.

Internally, calculations are made with more precision, adding two more sets of digits, $x;y;z$ become $x;y;z;z_2;z_3$ where $z_2$ is in shvâsa (6\textsuperscript{th} of pâla) and $z_3$ in bhâga, a fraction of shvâsa that varies according to calculation type. The table \TODO gives the corresponding precision in seconds:
\begin{itemize}
\item 707, corresponding to a precision of $3.14e-3$\,s (used for Sun and Moon)
\item 149209, $1.49e-5$\,s (used for planets)
\end{itemize}
