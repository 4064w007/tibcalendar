Tibetan Calendar and astrology library
====

This repository contains the source of libtibcalendar, a library aimed at
being a reference for Tibetan calendrical calculations.

It can now compute wih the following traditions:

 * Phugpa
 * Tsurphu
 * Sherab Ling

The goal is to add the following:

 * modern astronomy (see kalacakra.org)
 * Error correction system of Zhonu Pal

It is work in progress so any help is appreciated!
