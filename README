Here is the git repository for Tibastro (name to be changed?), a free
collaborative software project for tibetan astronomy, astrology and calendar
containing traditional (Phugpa and Tsurphu) as well as modern (Sherab Ling and
modern Kalacakra) calculations.

A wiki will also be set to point to safe sources and to explicit the 
calculations.
